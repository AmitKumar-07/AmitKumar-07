🌍 I’m currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at Paytm, focusing on scalable backend solutions in the Business vertical.

🌐 I have 2.5 years of professional experience in building high-performance systems using Spring Boot, Java 8, Kafka, Redis, and MySQL.

💡 I’m actively learning Low-Level Design (LLD) to enhance my software design skills.

📊 My previous experience includes solving numerous DSA problems in C++, and I’m revisiting key concepts to maintain my problem-solving edge.

🏀 Fun fact: I love playing cricket, which I include as a hobby to highlight my teamwork, strategy, and discipline skills.
